# Effects of Multi-Task Learning on ReLU Neural Networks
Code to reproduce experiments in "A New Neural Kernel Regime: The Inductive Bias of Multi-Task Learning" (https://openreview.net/forum?id=APBq3KAmFa&noteId=nQlxif7dhp) and "The Effects of Multi-Task Learning on ReLU Neural Network Functions" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21696).

To reproduce the univariate experiments in Figure 6 of the NeurIPS version run `univariate_example.ipynb`.

To reproduce the multi-variate experiments in Figure 7 of the NeurIPS version run `two_squares_example.ipynb`.

Both notebooks require the following packages
- numpy
- torch
- cvxpy
- matplotlib
